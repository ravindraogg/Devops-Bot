Root Cause: A process (likely Apache or another Nginx instance) is binding to port 80.  
Fix: Run `sudo lsof -i :80` to see which process is using it, then stop it (`sudo systemctl stop apache2`) or change your Nginx config to use another port.

I've begun dissecting the log snippets. My focus is on pinpointing root causes and formulating both short-term fixes and long-term improvements for each. Currently, I'm diving into the first log and identifying the key indicators of the issue.


**Reviewing Root Causes**

I'm now deeply engaged in a thorough analysis of the provided log snippets. My primary objective is to pinpoint the root cause of each issue, ensuring I can formulate effective short and long-term resolutions. Currently, I'm focusing on the first log snippet, and I'm zeroing in on the specific indicators that will help me determine the fundamental problems within the system. My process involves a deep dive into the provided information.


**Deep-Diving into the Analysis**

I'm now fully immersed in dissecting the provided logs, focusing on Example 2 and the underlying Docker container crash.  I've identified several potential root causes, focusing on discrepancies in the Dockerfile configuration, and am formulating targeted short and long-term fixes.  Currently, I am looking closely at the Dockerfile's COPY and WORKDIR instructions, pinpointing the exact command needed to address these concerns.


**Delving into Example 3**

I'm now fully engaged in the analysis of Example 3, which concerns a Kubernetes Pod's `CrashLoopBackOff` status. I've ascertained that the immediate issue isn't the status itself but rather the underlying reason for the container's consistent crashes. I'm prioritizing the examination of the container's logs from the previous failed attempt to uncover the primary cause, understanding that this could result from a wide array of issues. My plan is to identify the source of the crash, and recommend both immediate and long-term resolutions.


**Focusing on Detailed Analyses**

I've shifted my focus to the deep dive, meticulously analyzing the logs provided. I'm prioritizing Example 4, an SSH permission error within a GitHub Actions workflow, pinpointing potential culprits: misconfigured SSH keys, incorrect repository access, or an issue with the runner's environment itself. My immediate steps involve verifying the SSH key configuration and the permissions associated with the access key. Further investigation will be dedicated to Example 5.


**Deep Dive and Recommendations**

I'm finalizing the detailed analysis, having comprehensively reviewed all the examples. My focus is now on Example 1: `bind () to 0.0.0.0:80 failed`. I've determined that port conflict is the underlying root cause and that the short-term solution is to promptly stop the process currently using port 80. The long-term resolution involves ensuring that only a single webserver is deployed on each host. For implementing the fixes, I'll need to use `lsof` to find the process ID and then employ `kill` or `systemctl stop`. I plan to verify the solution by restarting Nginx and confirming its status.


**Finalizing the Review**

I'm wrapping up the final touches, particularly focusing on the PostgreSQL connection error. I've pinpointed the root cause as an incorrect password, specifically due to a mismatch between the provided credentials and those stored in the database. The short-term fix involves ensuring the correct password is used for authentication or resetting it within the database. For a long-term resolution, consider implementing stricter password policies, securing the database server by restricting access to authorized hosts, and reviewing the existing password configurations. I'm preparing commands for the database interaction. My next steps involve verifying the resolution by establishing a successful PostgreSQL connection.


**Revisiting Nginx Conflicts**

Now, I'm delving into the port conflict, examining Example 1 in detail. My focus is on the `lsof` and `netstat` output to identify the conflicting process. I'm preparing commands to stop the offending process and ensure Nginx can bind to port 80. Furthermore, I'll be confirming the fix using the relevant utilities.


"""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Alright, let's break these down one by one.

---

### Example 1: Nginx Port Conflict

**Logs:**
```
2025/08/16 12:21:45 [emerg] 1234#1234: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
2025/08/16 12:21:45 [emerg] 1234#1234: still could not bind()
```

**1. Root Cause Analysis**
The error `Address already in use` is unambiguous. Nginx is attempting to listen on TCP port 80 for all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), but another process has already claimed that port. This is often an old Nginx master process that didn't shut down correctly or another web server like Apache running on the same machine.

**2. Short-Term Fix**
Find the process currently using port 80 and stop it.

**3. Long-Term Fix**
Ensure your server provisioning and configuration management disables or uninstalls conflicting services. If you must run two services that need port 80, place one behind a reverse proxy or configure it to use a different port.

**4. Exact Commands**
First, identify the conflicting process and its PID (Process ID):
```bash
# Use lsof (list open files) or netstat to find the process on port 80
sudo lsof -i :80
# Or, an alternative command:
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :80
```
This will output the command and PID. For example, if you find `apache2` is using it, stop the service:
```bash
# Example if Apache is the culprit
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2 # Prevents it from starting on boot
```

**5. Verification Steps**
Now that the port is free, restart Nginx and check its status.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
systemctl status nginx
```
The status should show `active (running)`.

### Example 2: Docker Container Crash

**Logs:**
```
Error: Cannot find module '/usr/src/app/server.js'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:581:15)
    ...
```

**1. Root Cause Analysis**
The Node.js runtime inside the container cannot find the application entrypoint file, `server.js`, at the expected path `/usr/src/app/`. This is a build-time issue, not a runtime one. The problem is in your `Dockerfile`. Either the file was never copied into the image, it was copied to the wrong location, or a `.dockerignore` file is incorrectly excluding it.

**2. Short-Term Fix**
Correct the `Dockerfile` to ensure `server.js` is copied to the correct location specified in the `WORKDIR` or `CMD` instruction.

**3. Long-Term Fix**
Implement multi-stage builds. Use a linter for your Dockerfiles (like `hadolint`) in your CI pipeline. Add a smoke test to your build process that lists the contents of the image's working directory to ensure critical files are present before pushing the image.

**4. Exact Config Edits**
Your `Dockerfile` likely has an issue with the `COPY` or `WORKDIR` instructions. Ensure they are correct.

**Incorrect `Dockerfile` (Example):**
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /usr/src/
COPY . . # Maybe server.js is in a subdirectory?
CMD [\"node\", \"app/server.js\"] # Path is wrong relative to WORKDIR
```

**Correct `Dockerfile`:**
```dockerfile
# Sets the working directory for all subsequent commands
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copies package.json first for layer caching
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copies all source files into the working directory
COPY . .

# The command is now relative to /usr/src/app
CMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]
```

**5. Verification Steps**
Rebuild the image and run it locally to confirm it starts.
```bash
# Rebuild the image
docker build -t my-node-app .

# Run the container
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 my-node-app

# Check logs in another terminal if running detached
docker logs <container_id>
```The \"Cannot find module\" error should be gone.

### Example 3: Kubernetes Pod `CrashLoopBackOff`

**Logs:**
```
Warning  BackOff    12s (x4 over 45s)  kubelet  Back-off restarting failed container
Normal   Pulled     11s                kubelet  Container image \"myapp:latest\" already present on machine
Warning  Failed     11s                kubelet  Error: CrashLoopBackOff```

**1. Root Cause Analysis**
`CrashLoopBackOff` is a *status*, not an error. It means Kubernetes is successfully starting your pod's container, but the container is exiting with an error code almost immediately. Kubernetes tries to restart it, fails again, and enters an exponential back-off loop to avoid overwhelming the system. The *real* error is inside the container's logs.

**2. Short-Term Fix**
You need to retrieve the logs from a *previous*, failed instance of the container to find the actual crash reason.

**3. Long-Term Fix**
Implement robust Readiness and Liveness probes in your Kubernetes Deployment spec. A Readiness Probe ensures the pod only receives traffic when it's truly ready, and a Liveness Probe will restart a container that has become unresponsive. Also, ensure your CI pipeline includes steps to test the container image before it's deployed.

**4. Exact Commands**
First, describe the pod to see all events:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <your-pod-name>
```
This might give you clues. Next, get the logs from the previously terminated container:
```bash
# This is the key command
kubectl logs <your-pod-name> --previous
```
This command will print the logs from the last time the container ran, showing the error that caused it to crash (like the Node.js error from Example 2).

**5. Verification Steps**
After you identify the underlying error from the logs and fix it (e.g., by building and pushing a corrected Docker image), you must update your Kubernetes deployment.
```bash
# Option 1: Trigger a rollout with a new image tag
kubectl set image deployment/<your-deployment-name> myapp=myapp:v1.1

# Option 2: If using 'latest' tag (not recommended), delete the pod to force a pull
kubectl delete pod <your-pod-name>
```
Then watch the pod status to ensure it enters and stays in the `Running` state.
```bash
kubectl get pods --watch
```

### Example 4: GitHub Actions SSH Error

**Logs:**
```
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

**1. Root Cause Analysis**
The workflow is attempting a `git` operation using an SSH URL (`git@github.com:...`). The `Permission denied (publickey)` error means the GitHub Actions runner does not have an SSH private key that is authorized to access that repository.

**2. Short-Term Fix**
Configure the workflow to use an SSH key. Generate a new keypair, add the public key as a \"Deploy Key\" in your repository's settings, and add the private key as an encrypted \"Secret\" in the same repository.

**3. Long-Term Fix**
**Avoid SSH keys when you can.** For operations within the same repository, use the automatically generated `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. The `actions/checkout` action does this by default. If you need to push changes, you may need to grant write permissions to the token in your workflow file. Using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is more secure as it's scoped to the workflow run and requires no manual key management.

**4. Exact Config Edits**
If you absolutely must use an SSH key (e.g., for accessing a different private repository):

**a. Generate Keys:**
```bash
# Do this locally, not on the runner
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"github-actions-deploy-key\" -f deploy_key -N \"\"
# You get `deploy_key` (private) and `deploy_key.pub` (public)
```
**b. Add to GitHub:**
*   Go to `Repository Settings > Deploy Keys` -> Add `deploy_key.pub`.
*   Go to `Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` -> Add `deploy_key` as a secret named `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.

**c. Update Workflow YAML:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ssh-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      # Or if you need to use it for another command:
      - name: Setup SSH Key
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.9.0
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      - name: Push to another repo
        run: |
          git push git@github.com:my-org/another-repo.git
```

**5. Verification Steps**
Commit the changes to your workflow file and re-run the action. The step that previously failed should now complete successfully.

### Example 5: PostgreSQL Connection Error

**Logs:**
```
FATAL:  password authentication failed for user \"admin\"
DETAIL:  Password does not match for user \"admin\".
Connection matched pg_hba.conf line 95: \"host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5\"
```

**1. Root Cause Analysis**
The logs are very specific. A client application tried to connect to the PostgreSQL server as the user `admin`, but the password it provided was incorrect. The server's host-based authentication file (`pg_hba.conf`) accepted the connection attempt based on the client's IP and username, and then enforced `md5` password authentication, which failed.

**2. Short-Term Fix**
Update the password in your application's configuration (environment variable, connection string, etc.) to the correct one. If the password is lost, you'll need to connect to the database as a superuser and reset it for the `admin` user.

**3. Long-Term Fix**
Stop storing passwords in plain text configuration files or environment variables that are committed to version control. Use a dedicated secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault. Your application should fetch the credentials from the secrets store at startup. Implement a password rotation policy.

**4. Exact Commands**
To reset a lost password, you need to connect to the database with a user that has sufficient privileges (like the default `postgres` user).
```bash
# Connect to the database server using psql
psql -U postgres

# Inside the psql shell, run the ALTER USER command
ALTER USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'a-new-strong-password';
```

**5. Verification Steps**
Configure your client application with the new password and restart it. Alternatively, you can test the new credentials directly with `psql`.
```bash
# Attempt to connect as the 'admin' user from the client machine
psql -h <db-host> -U admin -d <database-name>
# It will prompt for the password. Enter the new one.
```
